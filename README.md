Place them in an accessible local directory

Replace the hardcoded paths in the script with your local paths as needed

Example:
python
Copy
Edit
# Original path (you should change this to match your setup)
directory=r'c:\Users\aryan\Downloads\dog\train'

# Update to your own local path like:
directory='/path/to/your/downloaded/train'
ðŸ”„ This flexibility ensures the script runs on any system â€” just customize the directory argument in flow_from_dataframe.
